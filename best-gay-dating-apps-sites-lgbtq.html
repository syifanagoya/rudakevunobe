Your dating pool seriously shrinks and fewer options mean fewer opportunities to meet someone special. For that reason, it's super important to make sure you're downloading the best gay dating apps or looking at the best LGBT dating sites.</p><p>After all, love it or loathe it, an increasing number of relationships start online, especially for LGBT people. Grindr, one of the best gay dating sites, has no fewer than 700,000 registered users in London alone. That’s a whole lot of people looking for love.&nbsp;</p><p>I was footloose and fancy free when Grindr first launched in 2009, revolutionising dating for gay men. Since then I've followed the explosion in dating apps, some of which have come and gone (Facebook Dating has not proved popular) while others have stayed around and got better and better.</p><p>The mainstream apps also deserve credit for the steps they've taken to create a more inclusive atmosphere: Tinder, Bumble and Hinge now offer lots of sexual orientation and gender identity options and have millions of registered users.</p><p>For this article I've reviewed 13 of the best apps and websites for LGBT dating. They all serve very different needs, so if one doesn’t work, in the words of the immortal Aaliyah, dust yourself off and try again.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The best LGBT dating apps and sites, at a glance</h2><ul><li><strong>Best dating app for gay men</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Grindr</a></li><li><strong>Best dating app for lesbian women</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Her</a></li><li><strong>Best dating app for gay, bi, trans and queer men</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Scruff</a></li><li><strong>Best dating app for relationships</strong> - <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>eHarmony</a></li><li><strong>Best dating app for non-binary, gender-fluid and transgender people</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taimi</a></li></ul><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">How we chose the best dating apps and sites</h2><p>To start, I looked for the most popular dating apps with the most users and the best word of mouth, which included Hinge, Zoosk, Grindr, Her and Scruff. I then looked at the best dating apps for different categories, including serious relationships, casual dating, free and paid.</p><p>To fully understand the user experience of those apps that I haven't tried personally, I spoke to members of the LGBT community whose personal feedback helped shape my final selection.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal">Best LGBT dating apps and sites</h2><p><strong>Best dating app for gay men, 10/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free membership (with limited functionality)</li><li>27 million users worldwide</li><li>Search tags to find others based on their interest</li><li>Available on the Apple App Store and Google Play</li></ul><p>Grindr brands itself as the world's largest dating app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people, but it's particularly the ideal gay paradise for men who are looking for experienced partners. It's also a place for bisexual men to experiment with a bigger user base. Instead of swiping to match, you'll get a collage of people who are close location-wise.&nbsp;</p><p>Grindr lacks the boundaries other apps provide and many users, just looking to hook up, will let you know that they're not in it for small talk: that warning may come in the form of an unsolicited pic.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not to say it's not for relationships. A lot of men meet their forever person on Grindr. But on the surface, it's a tool for quick, casual encounters. Men in small towns with a meager queer population are much more likely to find a connection here than on Tinder or eHarmony.</p><p>Register at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">grindr.com</a></p><p><strong>Best dating app for lesbian, bisexual, and queer femmes, 10/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free to register</li><li>10 million users worldwide</li><li>Apples App Store Editors’ Choice Award recipient three years running</li><li>Available on the Apple App Store and Google Play</li></ul><p>Although Her was made as a dating app, it in some way functions as a social media app. It has a feed much like Facebook’s, that allows you to see what others on the app are doing. For example, there's an event page to view upcoming queer events in your area and there is also a function to join “communities,” which allows you to meet people with similar interests. Of course, Her can also be used to swipe left or right for a soul mate, but its extra functions make it more than that.</p><p>The major drawback with Her is the paywall. If you want to see someone who has swiped right on you: paywall. If you want to chat with someone who is online near you, but you haven’t matched yet: paywall. If you want to have a decently lengthened conversation with someone you already matched with: paywall. If you have an extra £14.99 a month, you will have a great time. But for those single ladies on a budget, this may not be the one.</p><p>Register at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">weareher.com</a></p><p><strong>Best and safest dating app for gay, bi, trans and queer men, 10/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free membership (with limited functionality)</li><li>15 million users worldwide</li><li>Search tags to find others based on their interest</li><li>Available on the Apple App Store and Google Play</li></ul><p>Scruff is the top-rated and safest dating app for gay, bi, trans, and queer guys.

You can customise your profile to let guys know what you’re into and can even flirt with them by sending a woof.&nbsp;</p><p>Scruff prioritises security and offers 24/7 support for the LGBTQ community.

The website was founded in 2000 and pledged to match serious daters via an algorithm of in-depth questioning, which weeds out the impatient and guarantees that those on the site actually really want to be there. You’re offered specific daily matches within your location and you can’t browse elsewhere, so no meaningless swiping here.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, eharmony has been seen as a place for an older crowd, but this is changing. While for most of the site’s history the average age of users was 36 to 37 years old, it is now closer to 30.</p><p>They are committed to providing a platform that’s safe, inclusive and welcoming LGBT members and often publish blogs and tell love stories to demonstrate this – which, I won’t lie, can sometimes feel a little tokenistic.</p><p>It’s free to register and download the app, send ‘smiles’ and pre-written Icebreakers to get the conversation started. However, you need to subscribe for customised messages and unlimited access to your match’s profile. Subscription costs from £7.95 per month for 24 months.&nbsp;</p><p>Register at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">eharmony.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>Best dating app for non-binary, gender-fluid and transgender people, 9/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free membership (with limited functionality)</li><li>8 million users worldwide</li><li>Available on the Apple App Store and Google Play</li></ul><p>Taimi was originally launched for gay men but has now expanded to become an inclusive social network for the wider LGBTQ+ community.

In January this year Hinge, with support from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GLAAD</a>, released new conversation starters for profiles, specifically for LGBT users to help the community better connect based on similarities, interests, and compatibility.</p><p>Instead of cheesy questionnaires and spam emails about the 50 winks you've received, Hinge uses ice-breakers and lets you like up to eight people per day. Instead of swiping, connections are made by liking or commenting on another person's answers or photos.&nbsp;</p><p>Prompts range from "Two truths and a lie" to "Does hiking on a Sunday morning seem viable to you too?" Conversations are hidden after 14 days of inactivity to keep the focus on matches who are taking meeting seriously.</p><p>The top five cities in the UK for LGBT Hinge daters are London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and Belfast, so if you are looking for love in any of these cities, I’d get downloading now.</p><p>Register at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hinge.co</a></p><p><strong>Best LGBT dating site that hetero folks also use, 9/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free membership (with limited functionality)</li><li>40 million users worldwide</li><li>LGBT inclusive</li><li>Available online, on the Apple App Store and Google Play</li></ul><p>Zoosk is one of the most popular gay dating apps and diverse dating sites out there.

View prospective matches on the carousel, or use the SmartPick feature, which gives you personalised matches using Zoosk’s unique technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Another special feature Zoosk has is the Mega Flirt tool, which lets you send the same icebreaker question to several users at once.

Are you into bears? If you have tried gay dating apps where “bears” are only given their own category and do not represent the majority of the members on the app, then chances are that your experience was less than spectacular.</p><p>If you have been looking for a gay dating app that is focused primarily on the bear community, Growlr is your safest bet. Growlr is a dating app catering to a particular group of the gay community called “bears,” which are typically huge, rugged, hairy, and masculine gay men.&nbsp;</p><p>Around since 2014, Growlr uses the slogan, “more bears in more places.” You can search for bears by checking who is online and who is located near you. Look at the check-ins and bars feature to see which bears are hanging out close to where you are.</p><p>If you are interested in a Growlr member, all you have to do is click on the chat button on their profile to start connecting.</p><p>Register at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">growlrapp.com</a></p><p><strong>Best social media app for LGBT people, 7/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free membership (with limited functionality)</li><li>40 million users worldwide</li><li>Best for browsing and making friends</li><li>Available on the Apple App Store and Google Play</li></ul><p>Blued is for LGBT people who like to share video streams with the people who follow them. The app is more suited for those seeking to build large followers and make loose connections than those in search of a specific type of person to date. If you are looking for true love, it may prove disappointing.</p><p>Blued profiles feature the basic info provided in the signup process. The profile content often takes up the whole screen, so there’s no need to scroll down, as one can see the vital info like the member’s name, age, location, etc. The brief profile content could be because this platform is focused on matching members for casual dating. Instead of a detailed profile that gives you a more profound knowledge of an individual, looks matter the most here at Blued.&nbsp;</p><p>Register at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blued.com</a></p><p><strong>Best dating site for older gay people, 9/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free membership (with limited functionality)</li><li>70,000 users in the UK</li><li>LGBT inclusive</li><li>Available online, on the Apple App Store and Google Play</li></ul><p>Many popular gay dating apps have a reputation for frivolous fun rather than more serious relationships. It can be tough to meet someone who shares your preferences, lifestyle and is also looking for a long-term partner. And the truth is that it can get harder as you get older.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where Silver Singles comes in. As a dating site focused on over 50s dating, it offers more mature singles a platform to enjoy serious, senior gay dating. You can download it for Android or Apple smartphones and access your profile on your phone or tablet.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, to eHarmony, Silver Singles publishes blogs and tells love stories from LGBT community members but due to its target audience of over 50’s and their expert knowledge and stats, it comes from a place of knowing as opposed to generalisation.</p><p>Register at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">silversingles.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>Best for sheer number of LGBT users, 8/10</strong></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><ul><li>Free membership</li><li>Over 50 million users worldwide</li><li>LGBTQ inclusive</li><li>Available on the Apple App Store, Google Play and Apple Aptoide</li></ul><p>Credit where credit is due. Tinder has worked hard over the past few years to increase its understanding of the dating landscape and has therefore become one of the most inclusive and LGBT friendly dating apps on the market. Last year, Tinder reported that one in five of their matches were LGBT+.</p><p>Vanity does have a part to play, as the photo-heavy app with two billion views per day, allows you to swipe right to potential partners, then message and arrange a date. This can lead to a lack of substance as profiles are not as detailed as on other apps.

Plus, you can connect Spotify to let people see what you've been jamming out to.</p><p>In same-sex matching, either person has the power to make the first move, but there's a 24-hour time limit to start the chat after you match with someone. In Bumble chats, you're able to send GIFs and voice messages.

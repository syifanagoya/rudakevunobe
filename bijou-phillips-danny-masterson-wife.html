Because of that, he is in the spotlight.</p><p>The victim’s former girlfriend brought the charges against Danny Masterson.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the accusers were Scientology members when the alleged attacks took place, and they all claim that they were counseled by Scientology authorities to keep silent and avoid mentioning the phrase “the R-word.”</p><p>Even though one of the accusers sobbed on the witness box while testifying about an alleged horrific rape, it is being stated that Danny continues to have the full support of his wife, a Scientologist. <a href=#>Bijou Phillips</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, find everything you need to know about Bijou and her marriage to the actor from That ’70s Show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Danny Masterson’s wife? Bijou Phillips</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Who-is-Danny-Mastersons-wife-Bijou-Phillips.jpg><p>As the daughter of John Phillips (1935-2001) of the Mamas and the Papas and Geneviève Wate (1948-2019), a South African model, artist, and actress, Bijou Phillips was born into stardom on April 1, 1980.&nbsp;</p><p>Her mother was Geneviève Wate, and her father was John Phillips.&nbsp;</p><p>She followed in both her parent’s footsteps.

The record faced so much criticism from many critics.</p><p>After facing criticism, she started her career as an actress. She has since starred in several films and television episodes. It includes Almost Famous, The Door in the Floor, Raising Optimism, and Made for Each Other.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Danny Masterson & Bijou Phillips’s Relationship&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>They met for the first time at a poker game in Las Vegas in 2004.&nbsp; The two started dating and have been together ever since.</p><p>In March 2009, the couple publicly announced their engagement, tying the knot on October 18, 2011, in a ceremony held in their honor. In February 2014, they welcomed their daughter, Fianna Francis Masterson, into the world with Bijou as the proud delivery provider.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bijou Phillips Abuse actor Daniel Franzese</strong></h2><p>In November of 2017, actor Daniel Franzese, best known for his role as Damian in the television series Mean Girls, accused Bijou of harassing him while working together on the set of the 2001 film Bully.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the actor and comedian allegedly stated that Bijou “body shamed me and ridiculed me about my sexuality and physically assaulted me… I was scared and closeted and feared for my job.”</p><p>“It started with plenty of eye-rolling whenever we said, but it increased when we did a cast photoshoot for the poster,” Daniel said.&nbsp;</p><p>It was quite uncomfortable.&nbsp; While we were shooting, she started asking, “Are you gay?!&nbsp; and laughing, even though the producers and the photographer did nothing to stop her.”&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Bijou has expressed regret for her behavior.</p><p>During the same month, actress Heather Matarazzo invited Daniel on her podcast, Shut Up and Listen with Heather Matarazzo.</p><p>He claimed that Bijou had “thrown against a wall and put her hands around my neck and started choking me” shortly before filming began on their 2007 horror film Hostel: Part II. Daniel denied these allegations.</p><p>Danny Masterson involves in the rape case.</p><p>Judge Olmedo declared a mistrial and terminated it in November.&nbsp; When the jury still had not given a verdict.&nbsp;</p><p>Prosecutors claimed that he was drugged at that time.&nbsp; The woman claimed he had sexually assaulted her. But Masterson said he could defend himself by using his Scientology beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>As the retrial draws to a close, the court’s assessment of the evidence was unequivocal: the three witnesses’ testimony was not only credible but also sufficient to establish the charges.&nbsp;</p><p>In the period between October and December of 2003, the defendant allegedly invited two women to his home, where he purportedly sexually assaulted each of them.</p><p>2020 the actor was detained and freed three hours after Pathen million bail.

And star of the Netflix series The Ranch.</p><p>The Jane Does have filed a legal complaint against Masterson and the Church of Scientology. She alleges that they were the focus of a harassment campaign after coming forward with their charges against him.</p><p>Masterson and the Church of Scientology are also defendants in the complaint. The relevant civil case has reportedly been placed on hold but could be revived later this year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bijou cried When they Cuffed her Husband.</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bijou-cried-When-they-Cuffed-her-Husband.png><p>When the clerk announced that Masteron was found guilty of two counts of rape and may face up to 30 years in jail for his crimes, Masteron’s family members were in the crowd to hear the news.</p><p>Onlookers noticed her crying when Bijou’s husband was being led out of the courthouse. The date of the hearing has been fixed on August 4th.</p><p>After deliberating on the case of Masterson for a total of seven days stretched out over two weeks, the jury of seven people finally decided on Wednesday.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bijou Phillips Supports her husband in the Rape Case.</strong></h2><p>According to many reports, Bijou Phillips supports Danny Masterson in the rape trial he is currently facing.</p><p>Bijou has defended Danny in the face of many rape allegations. It’s going so far as publicly criticizing police reports about the alleged rape on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Chrissie Carnell-Bixler is the person who has accused Danny of rape.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a source who spoke to Us Weekly before the high-profile rape trial, Bijou will continue to support her husband throughout the proceedings.</p><p>The source disclosed to the magazine that “Bijou has been a total rock,” adding that the actress from Bridge to Nowhere “fully supports” Danny and believes that they will “get through this nightmare together and become stronger.”</p><p>Phillips let out a wailing sound as the decision was read out in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, six weeks after the case had begun.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge, Charlaine F. Olmedo, chastised the actress and instructed her to maintain her composure or exit the courtroom immediately.</p><p>Due to the “violent nature of the crimes” and the fact that Masterson was a potential flight risk, he was promptly remanded into custody.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time he is expected in court is on August 4th.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor at the center of this controversy was found guilty on two counts, but the jury could not reach a verdict on the third accusation of rape.&nbsp;</p><p>Masterson is looking at a possible sentence of thirty years in prison. The jury consisted of seven women and five men and deliberated for a little longer than a week.</p><p><strong>WHAT’S happened to Denny Masterson next?</strong></p><p>The actor will continue to be detained as he waits for his sentencing. It has yet to be set.</p><p>During the sentencing hearing, the woman was convicted of being raped by Masterson. It can make victim impact statements. And the judge is also likely to hear from Masterson’s supporters.</p><p>The attorneys representing Masterson did not comment on the verdict. Officials announced it.

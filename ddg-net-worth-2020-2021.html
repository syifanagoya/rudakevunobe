He started off by making about $30K a month from YouTube. He, later on, he went to Hollywood to pursue entertainment full time.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>DDG has not had much experience when it comes to dating yet. He has been channeling his energy into his music and entertainment career. However, he has had his fair share of heartbreak just like any other young person who’s fallen in love out there. He was in a relationship with a fellow YouTube star by the name of Kennedy Cymone.</p><p>Darryl’s love for Cymone was unstoppable and even proposed to her in 2018 after dating since 2017. Sadly their love story did not have a happy ending as the two love birds called it quits.

His height is 1.73m tall, and his weight is 75kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>DDG realized that he could rake in about $30K a month from being a YouTuber. That was the inception of his career path as an entertainer. After moving to Hollywood to focus on his craft, he created PontiacMadeDDG, his self-titled YouTube channel. His channel started getting recognition soon after he began posting videos. Some of the videos that went viral include Reacting to “My 7-Year-Old Niece Cringey”. More so, “White People Vs.

Furthermore, DDG released a diss track against American rapper Lil Yachty titled Big Boat. The track received massive viewership, with over 10 million views on YouTube.</p><p>However, it was his single Lettuce that caught the eye of big record labels. He eventually got signed by Epic records. He later released Givenchy, which made his popularity scale up a notch higher with over 25 million views on YouTube. DDG has continued to release more hit songs, and there is no stopping this young man.</p><p>Just three weeks ago, he released yet another single, Cotton Mouth. The track is not just well received but has over 1.4 million views in a span of just three weeks.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>The young artist has not received any awards yet.

However, being such an accomplished musician and YouTube star at his age is an achievement enough.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of DDG in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DDG-Net-Worth.jpg><p>In this new day and age, most Young stars are making a living from social media.

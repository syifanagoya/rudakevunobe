In his final year, he led his team to the British Columbia AAA Provincial Championship title and was hailed as the Province’s Player of the Year.</p><p>After completing his high school education, he tried for various American universities to no avail until he bagged a basketball scholarship to Santa Clara, thanks to the university’s coach Dick Davey who specially requested the video of Steve’s game.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>In 2005, Steve settled down in married life with Alejandra Amarilla. The couple was then blessed with a son, Matteo, and twin daughters, Lola and Bella before they eventually got divorced in 2012.
